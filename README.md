Meet Yuki, a very intelligent artificial intelligence who will love talking to you! :D

Yuki can talk about anything but sex and other harmful things, we forbid her to talk about these topics.

Other than that, Yuki is smart, understanding, and very intuitive! ^-^

For it to work download python3 and import the libraries: numpy, tflearn, tensorflow, random and json.

Without these python libraries, Yuki will not work. It is in the testing phase and may be updated
